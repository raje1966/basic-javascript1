const course = {
    coursename: "js in Hindi",
    price: "999",
    courseInstructor: "hitesh"
}

// Instead of repeating the code multiple times with:
// 1. course.coursename
// 2. price.price, etc, we can do this in better syntax mentioned below:
 const {courseInstructor} = course

console.log(courseInstructor);

//also we can shorten the courseInstructor to instructor saving time like:

const { courseInstructor: instructor } = course

console.log(instructor);

// it will yield the same value as above.  This is destructuring of object.

// Json can be in object or array form
