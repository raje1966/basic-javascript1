// IIFE is immediately invoked function expressions.

// Adding a() to the whole function syntax like mentioned below:

// (function raj() {
//     console.log('DB CONNECTED');
// })();

// By adding a () to the entire function syntax you get to see function executed.  The first () that engulfs the function is for definition of the function and the second () is for execution of the function.

   ( () => {
    console.log('DB Connected two');
   })()

   // The above mentioned arrow function can also be executed within a () and this is also a correct syntax.
